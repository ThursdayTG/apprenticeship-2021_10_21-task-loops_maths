After learning about for-loops the same day, we were given a small set of problems to solve using for-loops. While solving the basic problems, simply counting up and down in the first run and then down and up in the second run, was easy to solve, trying to optimise it as much as possible and going with as few for-loops as possible was considerably more difficult (at least within the given timeframe) - but it was interesting.
